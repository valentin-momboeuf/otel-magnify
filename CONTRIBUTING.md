# Contributing

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Every commit must be signed off with `--signoff`:

```bash
git commit --signoff -m "feat: description"
```

By signing off, you certify that your contribution complies with the
[DCO 1.1](https://developercertificate.org) — in short, that you have the right
to submit this code under the project's license.

## Local toolchain setup

This repo uses pre-commit and pre-push hooks managed by [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook). The hooks run linters and security checks before each commit/push.

### Required binaries

```bash
# macOS / Homebrew
brew install lefthook golangci-lint gitleaks hadolint

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) — install via each tool's release page
```

This project does **not** require a local Go toolchain. Tests and Go-only tools that need it (e.g. `govulncheck`) run inside a `golang:1.25` Docker container at pre-push time.

### Activate hooks (once per clone)

```bash
lefthook install
```

### Bypass

`git commit --no-verify` is tolerated only with a commit message explaining why. Do NOT bypass push hooks; they catch what CI would catch 2 minutes later anyway.

## Before submitting a PR

Make sure the tests pass:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && go test ./...

# Frontend types
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
```
