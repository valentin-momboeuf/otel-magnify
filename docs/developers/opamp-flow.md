# OpAMP flow

This page walks through the full lifecycle of an agent connection and config push, from first handshake to auto-rollback on failure.

All persistence is keyed by **workload** (the logical unit) — individual pods are tracked as **instances** in the in-memory registry only. See [Connecting agents / Workload identity](../users/connecting-agents.md#workload-identity) for how the fingerprint is derived.

## Connection and description

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant A as Instance (pod)
    participant O as OpAMP server
    participant R as Workload registry
    participant S as Store

    A->>O: WebSocket upgrade on /v1/opamp
    O->>A: Accept connection
    A->>O: AgentToServer{AgentDescription, Capabilities}
    O->>R: Fingerprint (k8s → host → uid) + register instance in RAM
    R->>S: Upsert workload (identity, labels, version)
    R->>S: Append workload_event (connected / version_changed)
    O-->>A: ServerToAgent{RemoteConfig} (P.2 auto-push if effective config diverges)
    O->>A: ServerToAgent{} (empty, acknowledges)
    loop heartbeat
        A->>O: AgentToServer{Health, EffectiveConfig?}
        O->>S: Update last-seen, effective config, health
    end
```

The registry runs the three fingerprint strategies in order and picks the first one whose required attributes are present:

1. **k8s** — when `k8s.namespace.name` plus a workload-kind attribute (`k8s.deployment.name`, `k8s.daemonset.name`, `k8s.statefulset.name`, `k8s.job.name`, or `k8s.cronjob.name`) are set, combined with `k8s.cluster.name` (defaults to `unknown`).
2. **host** — `service.name` + `host.name` for bare-metal or VM deployments.
3. **uid** — fallback on the OpAMP `InstanceUid`; cardinality 1 per process.

P.2 auto-push: when a new instance of an existing workload reports an effective config hash that differs from the workload's active config, the server immediately pushes the active config without waiting for an operator action. This keeps newly-scheduled pods convergent with the stored intent.

## Config push with success

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as UI
    participant API as REST API
    participant O as OpAMP server
    participant A as Instance
    participant S as Store
    participant WS as WebSocket hub

    U->>API: POST /api/workloads/{id}/config (raw YAML)
    API->>API: Validate against AvailableComponents
    API->>S: Insert workload_configs row (status=pending)
    API->>O: Trigger push for workload {id}
    O->>A: ServerToAgent{RemoteConfig} (fan-out to every live instance)
    A->>O: AgentToServer{RemoteConfigStatus: APPLYING → APPLIED}
    O->>S: Update row (status=applied)
    O->>WS: broadcast workload_config_status
    WS-->>U: live update
```

## Config push with failure and auto-rollback

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as UI
    participant O as OpAMP server
    participant A as Instance
    participant S as Store
    participant WS as WebSocket hub

    Note over O,A: A bad config was just pushed
    A->>O: AgentToServer{RemoteConfigStatus: FAILED, error}
    O->>S: Update row (status=failed, error_message)
    O->>S: Load last-applied config for the workload
    O->>A: ServerToAgent{RemoteConfig: last-good}
    O->>S: Insert new row (status=pending, pushed_by=auto-rollback)
    O->>WS: broadcast auto_rollback_applied
    A->>O: AgentToServer{RemoteConfigStatus: APPLIED}
    O->>S: Update rollback row (status=applied)
    WS-->>U: live update
```

## Disconnect, grace period, and retention

When an instance disconnects, the registry removes it from RAM and appends a `disconnected` workload event. If no live instances remain, the workload stays `connected` for `WORKLOAD_DISCONNECT_GRACE_SECONDS` (default 120 s) — this absorbs rolling updates and pod restarts without flapping the UI. After the grace the workload flips to `disconnected`; the janitor goroutine archives it after `WORKLOAD_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) and trims the `workload_events` log after `WORKLOAD_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30).

## Available components capture

When an instance connects, it advertises the modules compiled into it via `AvailableComponents`. otel-magnify persists this on the workload and uses it to validate config pushes before sending them — rejecting configs that reference receivers, processors, or exporters the collector cannot run.
