# Testing

Use this page as the quick pre-PR checklist for local verification. Run the smallest focused test first while iterating, then run the relevant CI-equivalent gate before opening a PR.

## Backend

The Go module lives at the repository root and currently declares Go `1.25.12` in `go.mod`.

```bash
TEST_POSTGRES_DSN="${TEST_POSTGRES_DSN:?set a disposable PostgreSQL 18 DSN}" \
  TEST_POSTGRES_MAJOR=18 \
  go test ./...
go build ./...
```

If your local Go version is older than `go.mod`, use the same container pattern as CI:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD:/app" \
  -w /app \
  -e GOFLAGS='-mod=mod -buildvcs=false' \
  -e TEST_POSTGRES_DSN="${TEST_POSTGRES_DSN:?set TEST_POSTGRES_DSN to a disposable PostgreSQL 18 database}" \
  -e TEST_POSTGRES_MAJOR=18 \
  golang:1.25.12 sh -c 'go build ./... && go test ./...'
```

Go tests require a PostgreSQL 18 database. Set `TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` to a disposable database; the test suite verifies the major version and creates and removes an isolated schema for each test.

## Benchmarks

Targeted benchmarks are used as performance guardrails for hot validation paths. They are not thresholded in CI, but the pre-tag gate runs a one-iteration smoke check so regressions that break benchmark execution are caught before release tagging.

Run the config validation guardrail benchmark locally with:

```bash
go test -run '^$' -bench '^BenchmarkValidateMinimalConfig$' -benchmem ./internal/validator
```

## Frontend

Run frontend checks from `frontend/`:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:unit
```

`npm run build` runs TypeScript project checking (`tsc -b`) and then Vite build, which matches the CI frontend gate.

## End-to-end and integration checks

- Cold Community activation: `./scripts/activation-smoke.sh` builds an
  isolated Compose stack, requires an exact `ready` response, verifies
  PostgreSQL major 18, creates and later revokes a managed token, mounts it as a
  mode-`0600` file into the non-root simulator, and exercises bootstrap, login,
  workload discovery, governed push, and final OpAMP `applied` status within 15
  minutes.
- PostgreSQL lifecycle: `./scripts/postgres-lifecycle-test.sh` verifies the signed v0.7.1 baseline, PostgreSQL 16-to-18 dump/restore, current migrations, restart, and pre-upgrade restore paths with real isolated databases.
- Helm activation contract: `./scripts/helm-activation-test.sh` verifies Secret references and fail-closed rendering without exposing secret values.
- Mocked Playwright E2E: `cd frontend && npm run test:e2e`.
- Real-backend Playwright flow: `./scripts/e2e-real.sh` or `cd frontend && npm run test:e2e:real` when you intentionally want Docker-backed services.
- SDK agent simulator: `cmd/sdkagent/` exercises the OpAMP pipeline without a real Collector.
- Docker Compose provides the PostgreSQL service used by the real-backend E2E suite.

Managed-token and secure-client changes use the pinned Go image:

```bash
docker run --rm --volume "$PWD:/app" --workdir /app golang:1.25.12 \
  go test ./internal/opampauth ./internal/opamp ./internal/api ./internal/store \
  ./pkg/server ./cmd/sdkagent ./cmd/opamp-load
```

The store and API packages require the disposable PostgreSQL 18 test
environment described above. The activation and load-test clients accept
credentials only through `--token-file`; plaintext WS additionally requires
`--allow-insecure-transport`.

## Docs and hygiene checks

Documentation-only PRs still trigger docs quality checks:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
mkdocs build --strict
```

CI also runs markdownlint and a non-blocking lychee broken-link report for Markdown changes.
