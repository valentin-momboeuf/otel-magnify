# Backend

This page is the contributor quick-start for the Go backend. For the high-level system diagram, see [Architecture](architecture.md). For endpoint contracts, see [REST API](../api/rest.md).

## Local development setup

The Go module lives at the repository root:

```bash
go version
TEST_POSTGRES_DSN="${TEST_POSTGRES_DSN:?set a disposable PostgreSQL DSN}" go test ./...
```

Use the Go toolchain declared in `go.mod`; do not rely on older minimum versions from stale screenshots or blog posts.

The production binary embeds a pre-built frontend, but backend-only development can run without rebuilding frontend assets:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@example.invalid"
read -r -s -p "Initial admin password (minimum 12 characters): " SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD
echo
export SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD
DB_DSN="${DB_DSN:?set DB_DSN through your local secret workflow}" go run ./cmd/server/
```

Default listeners:

- API, health check, embedded SPA, and browser WebSocket hub: `http://localhost:8080`.
- OpAMP WebSocket server: disabled until native TLS files are configured;
  `OPAMP_INSECURE=true` explicitly enables
  `ws://localhost:4320/v1/opamp` for a trusted local test network.
- Browser WebSocket hub: `ws://localhost:8080/ws` using the `om_session` HttpOnly cookie; `/ws?token=<jwt>` remains a legacy fallback.

For frontend development, run Vite separately from `frontend/`; the default backend CORS origin allows `http://localhost:5173`.

## Package map

| Package | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| `cmd/server/` | Process entrypoint. Loads env config, opens the store, runs migrations, wires auth/server/bootstrap. |
| `internal/config/` | Environment-variable parsing and defaults. |
| `pkg/bootstrap/` | Runtime bootstrap that can be reused by alternate binaries; enforces required `JWT_SECRET` and seeds the first admin when requested. |
| `pkg/server/` | Composes store, auth, router hooks, alert notifier(s), audit logger, feature flags, static assets, OpAMP server, alert engine, and workload janitor. |
| `internal/api/` | chi router, REST handlers, browser WebSocket hub, auth/permission middleware adapters, and SPA static serving. |
| `internal/auth/` | HS256 JWT minting/validation and bearer-token middleware. Tokens expire after 24 hours. |
| `internal/opampauth/` | Managed OpAMP token generation, strict parsing, and hashing. |
| `internal/perm/` | RBAC permission matrix for system groups (`viewer`, `editor`, `administrator`). |
| `internal/opamp/` | OpAMP server lifecycle, workload identity, available component tracking, config fan-out, and status aggregation. |
| `internal/audit/` | Durable token-lifecycle audit outbox dispatcher. |
| `internal/alerts/` | Alert engine and notifier fan-out. The engine ticks every 30 seconds in `pkg/server`. |
| `internal/workloads/` | Workload janitor that archives expired disconnected workloads and trims old events. |
| `internal/store/` | PostgreSQL persistence plus goose migrations. |
| `pkg/models/` | Shared domain structs serialized by the API and persisted by the store. |
| `pkg/ext/` | Extension interfaces used by community and enterprise binaries: auth methods, audit logger, notifier, store abstractions. |

## Runtime composition

`pkg/bootstrap.Run` is the normal startup path:

1. Load `internal/config.Config` from environment variables.
2. Fail closed when `JWT_SECRET` is unset, the placeholder is used, or the secret is too short.
3. Require `DB_DSN`, open the PostgreSQL store, and run migrations.
4. Optionally create the first administrator, atomically and only on an empty users table, from `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
5. Construct `pkg/server.Server` with any extension options supplied by the binary.
6. Start the API listener, alert engine, workload janitor, WebSocket hub, and
   the OpAMP listener only when native TLS or explicit local insecure transport
   resolves successfully.

`pkg/server.Server` exposes extension points through options such as:

- `WithNotifier` for alert delivery integrations.
- `WithAuditLogger` for persistent audit sinks.
- `WithRouterHook` and `WithProtectedRouterHook` for extra routes/middleware.
- `WithAuthMethod` and `WithAuthMethodProvider` for additional login methods.
- `WithCapabilities` for typed capability declarations exposed by `GET /api/v1/capabilities`.
- `WithFeatures` for legacy edition overlays exposed by `GET /api/features`.
- `WithLicenseChecker` for edition/entitlement checks on gated endpoints.

## Capability discovery

`GET /api/v1/capabilities` is the canonical public capability-discovery endpoint. `GET /api/features` remains a legacy boolean compatibility endpoint. `WithCapabilities` is preferred for typed declarations; `WithFeatures` remains supported for legacy edition overlays.

```go
import (
    "github.com/magnify-labs/otel-magnify/pkg/capabilities"
    "github.com/magnify-labs/otel-magnify/pkg/server"
)

func capabilityOption() (server.Option, error) {
    registry, err := capabilities.New([]capabilities.Capability{
        {ID: "config_safety.approvals", State: capabilities.StateEnabled},
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return server.WithCapabilities(registry), nil
}
```

The versioned document has three states: `enabled`, `disabled`, and `read_only`. An `enabled` capability must not include `reason_code`; every `disabled` or `read_only` capability requires one. Valid reason codes are `not_enabled`, `prerequisite_unavailable`, and `read_only_mode`.

Community advertises only `config_safety.approvals` and `config_safety.policy_preview` in this release. The legacy endpoint projects the same registry into booleans for older edition overlays.

Capability discovery is not authorization. Protected APIs still enforce authentication, RBAC, and server-side gates. `WithLicenseChecker` is consulted by server-side gates and does not add capabilities to either public discovery response.

## Database notes

- PostgreSQL is the only supported database. `DB_DSN` is required and must be a PostgreSQL connection string.
- Migrations are managed with `pressly/goose` and run automatically on startup.
- Store tests use isolated PostgreSQL schemas through `TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`.

## Security caveats for contributors

- Never add a default production JWT secret. `JWT_SECRET` is required at startup and should be generated by the operator.
- Avoid logging request bodies that may contain Collector YAML, DSNs, passwords, bearer tokens, webhook URLs, or exporter credentials.
- Browser WebSocket auth uses the `om_session` HttpOnly cookie. Avoid copying legacy `/ws?token=...` URLs with real tokens into logs, docs, or screenshots.
- Every OpAMP handshake requires a managed token validated through the store.
  Generic `401` covers invalid, unknown, expired, and revoked credentials;
  store failures return generic `503`.
- Managed token creation and revocation atomically enqueue durable audit
  outbox events. At-least-once dispatch starts only for a persistent Enterprise
  sink wired through `WithAuditOutboxSink`, so sinks must deduplicate by
  `event_id`. `AUDIT_SINK=stdout` wires no dispatcher and leaves the rows
  pending.
- `OPAMP_INSECURE=true` is restricted to trusted local tests. Production uses
  native TLS certificate/key files and WSS.
- Feature flags are discovery metadata, not authorization. Keep RBAC checks on protected handlers even if the UI hides a feature.
- Mutating handlers that emit audit records may return `503` with `side_effect_status`; callers must reconcile according to that field rather than blindly retrying every mutation.
