# Managing configs

otel-magnify stores configurations centrally and pushes them to connected workloads over OpAMP. Each push is recorded with its hash, the operator who triggered it, the reported status, and the error message (if any). Configs are pushed to a **workload**, not to an individual pod — every live instance of the workload receives the push, and any new pod that connects later is immediately brought in line with the active config (P.2 auto-push).

## Workflow

1. Open a workload from the **Inventory** page.
2. Edit the YAML in the embedded CodeMirror editor.
3. Click **Validate** — the backend runs a light structural check and blocks the push if errors are found. Errors are listed inline.
4. Click **Push** to send the configuration to every live instance of the workload.
5. Each instance reports a `RemoteConfigStatus` — the UI aggregates them and updates live via WebSocket.

## Validation

The `POST /api/workloads/{id}/config/validate` endpoint performs a lightweight YAML sanity check against the workload's reported `AvailableComponents`. It does **not** attempt a full Collector-side validation; the agent is the ultimate authority. If an instance rejects the config after push, otel-magnify records the error message returned by the agent.

## Auto-rollback

When a workload reports a `failed` status, otel-magnify automatically re-pushes the last known-good configuration. The rollback is recorded as a **new** `workload_configs` row (status `pending`, `pushed_by = "auto-rollback"`) — the failed row is left in place for auditing. An `auto_rollback_applied` event is broadcast on the WebSocket.

## Push history

Every push is stored in the `workload_configs` table with:

- Config content hash
- Operator (`pushed_by` — the user's email, or `auto-rollback` for automated recoveries)
- Timestamp
- Status (`pending`, `applied`, or `failed`)
- Error message if the agent rejected the config

The history is visible from the workload detail page.
