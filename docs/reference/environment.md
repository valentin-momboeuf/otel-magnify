# Environment variables

Exhaustive community-server runtime reference. See [Configuration](../users/configuration.md) for a user-oriented walkthrough.

| Variable | Required | Default | Scope | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | — | Auth | HS256 signing key for JWT tokens. Startup fails when this is unset, when the placeholder value is used, or when the value is shorter than 32 characters. Use a strong random value; at least 32 bytes is recommended for HMAC-SHA256. |
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | No | `:8080` | API | HTTP listen address for the REST API, embedded frontend, health check, and browser WebSocket hub. |
| `OPAMP_ADDR` | No | `:4320` | OpAMP | Listen address for the OpAMP WebSocket server. The OpAMP path is `/v1/opamp`. |
| `OPAMP_INSECURE` | No | `false` | OpAMP | Exact `true` enables plaintext WS only for a trusted local test network. `false` requires both TLS file variables; without them, the OpAMP listener is disabled while the API remains available. |
| `OPAMP_TLS_CERT_FILE` | No | — | OpAMP | Server certificate chain path for native WSS. Required with `OPAMP_TLS_KEY_FILE` unless insecure local mode is explicitly enabled. |
| `OPAMP_TLS_KEY_FILE` | No | — | OpAMP | Server private-key path for native WSS. Required with `OPAMP_TLS_CERT_FILE` unless insecure local mode is explicitly enabled. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | No | `http://localhost:5173` | API | Comma-separated list of allowed browser origins. Docker Compose sets this to `http://localhost:8080` for same-origin production-style access. |
| `DB_DSN` | Yes | — | Store | PostgreSQL 18.x connection string. Docker Compose supplies a local service URL; use `sslmode=verify-full` with a trusted root CA and hostname verification in production. |
| `DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS` | No | `40` | Store | Maximum PostgreSQL connections held open. |
| `DB_MAX_IDLE_CONNS` | No | `10` | Store | Maximum idle PostgreSQL connections retained. |
| `DB_CONN_MAX_IDLE_TIME_SECONDS` | No | `300` | Store | Maximum time a pooled connection may remain idle, in seconds. |
| `DB_CONN_MAX_LIFETIME_SECONDS` | No | `1800` | Store | Maximum lifetime for a pooled connection in seconds. |
| `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` | No | — | Bootstrap | First-admin email. Must be set with `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; bootstrap only creates a user when the users table is empty. |
| `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | No | — | Bootstrap | First-admin password, minimum 12 characters. Remove both seed variables after the first successful login. |
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | No | — | Alerts | HTTP endpoint called when a new alert fires. Treat as sensitive if it contains embedded credentials. |
| `MIN_AGENT_VERSION` | No | — | Alerts | Minimum `service.version`; workloads reporting a lower semantic version are flagged by the alert engine. Empty disables this rule. |
| `WORKLOAD_DISCONNECT_GRACE_SECONDS` | No | `120` | Workloads | Seconds a workload remains `connected` after its last live instance disconnects, absorbing rolling updates and short restarts. Invalid or non-positive values fall back to one second. |
| `WORKLOAD_RETENTION_DAYS` | No | `30` | Workloads | Days a `disconnected` workload is kept before archival by the workload janitor. Invalid or non-positive values fall back to 30 days. |
| `WORKLOAD_JANITOR_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | No | `300` | Workloads | Workload janitor tick interval. The janitor archives expired workloads and purges old events. Invalid or non-positive values fall back to one second. |
| `WORKLOAD_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` | No | `30` | Workloads | Days the `workload_events` log is kept before the janitor trims it. Invalid or non-positive values fall back to 30 days. |

## Load-test variables

These variables are consumed only by `scripts/load-test-5000.sh`; they are not
community-server runtime configuration. The script generates invocation-local
JWT, database, admin, and managed OpAMP token credentials under a private
temporary directory and ignores inherited credential variables.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LOAD_TEST_CONFIRM` | Yes | — | Must be exactly `5000` before the script will start the 5,000 collector scenario. |
| `LOAD_TEST_RAMP` | No | `5m` | Go duration used to spread 5,000 client starts. |
| `LOAD_TEST_HOLD` | No | `10m` | Go duration that keeps established connections open. |
| `LOAD_TEST_READY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | No | `900` | Positive integer timeout for all 5,000 clients to reach the hold phase. |

## Feature flags

Feature flags are not configured through environment variables in the community binary. `GET /api/v1/capabilities` is the canonical public capability-discovery endpoint; `GET /api/features` remains a legacy boolean compatibility endpoint. `WithCapabilities` is preferred for typed declarations; `WithFeatures` remains supported for legacy edition overlays.

Community advertises only `config_safety.approvals` and `config_safety.policy_preview` in this release. The canonical response is:

```json
{
  "api_version": "v1",
  "capabilities": [
    { "id": "config_safety.approvals", "state": "enabled" },
    { "id": "config_safety.policy_preview", "state": "enabled" }
  ]
}
```

Capability discovery is not authorization; protected APIs still enforce authentication, RBAC, and server-side gates. `WithLicenseChecker` is a server-side gate input and does not change the public capability document.

## Sensitive values

The following values should not be pasted into public issues, docs, logs, or screenshots:

- Real `JWT_SECRET` values.
- Managed OpAMP token values, including client-side `OPAMP_TOKEN`.
- Private keys referenced by `OPAMP_TLS_KEY_FILE`.
- PostgreSQL credentials inside `DB_DSN`.
- Credential-bearing `WEBHOOK_URL` values.
- Bearer JWTs and WebSocket URLs containing `?token=`.
- Collector YAML that embeds exporter credentials, API keys, or endpoint passwords.
